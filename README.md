# Six-Degree-of-Freedom Freehand 3D Ultrasound: A Low-Cost Computer Vision-Based Approach for Orthopedic Applications
This is the minimum dataset generated from the experiments carried out during the study, necessary to replicate the results shown in the research article [Link](https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics14141501).

For each of the four tests, three files are available:
- Marker trajectories obtained from the stereophotogrammetric system (.tsv);
- Array with the color frames of the camera and the related acquisition timestamps (.npz);
- Associative array with calibration parameters (.pkl).

Due to the large file size, the array data can be downloaded from MEGA: https://mega.nz/file/4rgSUYxC#JbhXp0oNitj4PwGTlY8-bO2rxdzrpyJFZiQTQyjRIh8
