# 6DoF freehand 3D Ultrasound: a low cost technique using computer vision tracking
This is the minimum dataset generated from the experiments carried out during the study entitled "6 DOF Freehand 3D Ultrasound: A Low-Cost Computer Vision-based Approach for Orthopedic Applications", necessary to replicate the results shown in the research article (not available at the moment ).

For each of the four tests, three files are available:
- Marker trajectories obtained from the stereophotogrammetric system (.tsv);
- Array with the color frames of the camera and the related acquisition timestamps (.npz);
- Associative array with calibration parameters (.pkl).
